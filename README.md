## Contribution Guide:
1. Put your code onto the right folder tag (example: DFS to Graph).
2. It is recommended to first test out your code, comment out what the program does, and comment the time complexity and memory complexity.
4. Format your code on [cpp-beautifier](https://codebeautify.org/cpp-formatter-beautifier), on 2 indent (you may change it afterward to style it to your better liking).
5. Kindly add your code to [bit.ly/cheatsheet-inf](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hmosulALdIKsXlB38Ww-dRc3S7vMVv_ldFe611bYj3M/edit?usp=sharing), ordered alphabetically.
